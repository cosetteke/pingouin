                <p>Dear colleagues and students,</p>
<p>The end of the first semester is gradually approaching. The past few months have been hectic and I believe this will remain so for the foreseeable future, both off- and on-campus. My appreciation and gratitude for the way you have shaped our university in these extraordinary times is great.</p>
<p>With this message, I would like to look ahead at the way our educational activities will be organized during the second semester. Because we want to give everyone the chance to prepare themselves and because we want to provide guidance.</p>
<p>The Flemish government has – in consultation with the rectors of all Flemish universities and acting, among other things, on the advice of a great many scientists/experts – decided that the second semester educational activities of the universities and university colleges will start in code red.</p>
<p>The organization of essential practice classes, the availability of study areas and extra guidance for students in the first bachelor year will be our priority.</p>
<p>Code red will remain in effect at our university for six weeks of classes (i.e. up to and including March 21st, 2021). At the end of February, the epidemiological situation will be re-evaluated to assess the possibilities for the organization of teaching activities during the remaining weeks of classes.</p>
<p>What does this mean concretely for the educational activities at Ghent University at the start of the second semester?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<pre><code>  No lectures are allowed on-campus.
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<pre><code>  Essential practice classes, lab classes, seminars and practice exercises will be allowed on-campus. These teaching activities will be organized according to strict safety guidelines.
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<pre><code>  For students in the first bachelor year and for other students who are studying at Ghent University for the first time, specific teaching activities will be allowed on-campus.
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<pre><code>  Students who need to do so, can make use of on-campus study areas throughout the second semester. Strict safety measures apply there and they will be monitored at all times to make sure that the measures are observed. You can reserve a seat in these study areas via the web page https://studieplekken.ugent.be/information
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>More information about the organization of our teaching activities in the second semester can be found on the Ghent University website: https://www.ugent.be/student/en/academic-year-20-21/secondsemester.htm</p>
<p>At this time, activities organized by student associations are not allowed on-campus. As soon as the Consultation Committee indicates that it is possible to relax the measures that affect these activities, there will be an examination of whether/how student activities will, once again, be allowed to take place on-campus.</p>
<p>The current general Ghent University corona policies still apply. You can find out more about them on https://www.ugent.be/en/news-events/coronameasures.htm</p>
<p>The recent evolution of the corona indicators are a clear sign that we must remain cautious and caring. Therefore: continue to help each other. Do not let go of one another.</p>
<p>Rik Van de Walle<br>
Rector</p>
